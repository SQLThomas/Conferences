Thank you again for attending my session.
To replay what I demoed with my script, you need to prepare the following:

* A database named Spatial1 
Here, you can create a playground with basic shapes by running the commented CREATE and INSERT statements.

* A database named Spatial2 
Download the polish administrative shapefiles (which I am not allowed to redistribute) from http://www.diva-gis.org/gdata and import them into the database, using the Shape2SQL tool from https://www.sharpgis.net/page/SQL-Server-2008-Spatial-Tools (hope it works for you).
